# Php_Activity
The activity involves designing and implementing a dynamic web form using PHP, where users can input their personal details. The form dynamically accepts user input, validates it, and provides instant feedback if any field is left empty or filled incorrectly. The collected data is also stored in a text file for record-keeping.
